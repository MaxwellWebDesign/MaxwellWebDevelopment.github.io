        <p>Touch both the Eurasian and North American plate at the same time when diving in the clear waters of Silfra. The water, being almost completely transparent, refracts light in a similar manner that crystals do. The stunning landscape is composed of lava rock, sand, and algae and attracts snorklers from all over the world. Silfra can be enjoyed all year, whether it is summer or winter. Either way, the waters of the rift can reach 2Â° Celsius so make sure to bring a jacket!</p>

        <h3>Skaftafell Ice Caves</h3>
